phosphor-float-area
===================

This is a MDI style container for PhosphorJS widgets that can be freely dragged inside it.
It's compatible with DockPanel so when placed inside one, widgets can be docked and undocked on the edges.

Coding style
------------

We try to match PhosphorJS with these exceptions:

- Tab instead of 2 spaces for indentation.
- No space between `if` or `for` and the following parenthesis.
- No `I` prefix in interface names.
- Parentheses around `return` statement argument.

These choices match other `charto` projects.
